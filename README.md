# Graduation-Project-Bacteria-Detection-system-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-
Here I will provide some of my work in My graduation Project 

The idea of our Graduation Project is:
Implementing detection of bacteria in food by different machine learning algorithms to determine its amount and its type to check validity of food. The project is a sub system of bigger system which the samples will be scanned first by NIR enhanced handy commercial spectrometer and spectral data obtained will be analyzed by our machine learning models.
